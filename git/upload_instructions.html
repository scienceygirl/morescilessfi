        <p>Here's some notes I made for you, babe</p>
        <p>Get to your terminal in VS Code by pressing  <b>"ctrl and ~"</b></p>
        <p>
            git add --all <br/>
            git commit -m "changes made" <br/>
            git push -u origin master <br/>
        </p>
        <p>You can also get to previous commands by pressing up in the terminal</p>
        <p>Love you!</p>
