								<h3>Why is Data Analysis Important?</h3>
								<h5 class="date">22 OCT 2019</h5>
								<p>What's the point of knowing something and not sharing it with others?</p>

								<p>One of the many goals of my website it to help share the knowledge that I come across; to help others learn something that they may not know, expand on what they may know, lead to me learning more, and to hopefully improve the world's knowledge as a whole.</p>

								<p>Lofty goals, I know.  But here we are!  Let's science!</p>

								<p>First up: data analysis.  Why is this so important?  We obtain so much information when we do science and receive so much data.  What we do with this data is one of the many goals of performing science.</p>

								<p>One of the biggest issues that we run in to with data, is that we don't have enough of it to make a real conclusion.  What I mean by this is that if we perform an experiment only once, we cannot confirm that the data is replicable.  We have to be able to obtain the same results, again and again and again...you get the point.</p>

								<p>When we also have small data samplings, we also are more likely to cherry-pick the data.  If we look at a small amount of data, which could include time or the actuall results, for example, and we can draw incorrect conclusions from said information.  This is where some people may be misled by data and lead to such horribly incorrect conclusions, such as vaccines cause autism.</p>

								<p>Data analysis can provide us with so much information!  Connections can be made in the "cause and effect" method, showing how things work.  The data can also be used as a jumping point to new questions that come up.  "So this was the data!  I wonder what would happen if I changed x?"  This is the true heart of science.</p>

								<p>Data analysis is so exciting to me because I get to see the results of science and the connections it makes to our lives!</p>

								<p>Data rules!</p>

								<h3>Let's Science!</h3>
								<h5 class="date">20 OCT 2019</h5>
								<p>Welcome to my inaugural blog post!</p>

								<p>I am so excited to further my knowledge of science by sharing information with you. I'll also be sharing some information about topics that I have knowledge of that I think would be interesting, and more specifically ties in to my life by way of my hobbies, news, and just things I think are awesome!</p>

								<p>Be sure to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/morescilessfi">@morescilessfi</a>  (or see bottom of the page).</p>

								<p>Let's science!</p>
